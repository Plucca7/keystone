// (constitution, clarify, plan-and-tasks, verify, test-first-by-risk, subagent-driven-development,
// discovery) and the Layer C experience-quality rules; harness.test.ts keeps the harness
// scaffolding, pre-push gate, server-side rails, and the two guardrail-hook tests. No test
// content was changed by the split -- only moved.
