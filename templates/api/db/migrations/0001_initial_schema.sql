-- Foundation migration: extensions, the shared updated_at trigger function,
-- and one example table ("items") that embodies every database convention of
-- this template. New tables copy this shape.
--
-- Convention: ALL database identifiers (tables, columns, functions, indexes,
-- policies) are snake_case. Postgres folds unquoted identifiers to lowercase,
-- so camelCase would force quoting every identifier in every query forever.
-- Application code stays camelCase; the repository layer owns the mapping.

-- pgcrypto provides gen_random_uuid(). Postgres 13+ ships it in core, but we
-- enable the extension explicitly so the migration also works on hosts that
-- still wire the function through pgcrypto.
create extension if not exists pgcrypto;

-- Shared trigger function: keeps updated_at honest on every UPDATE.
-- Why a trigger and not application code: every write path (app, psql,
-- another service) gets the same behavior; nobody can forget to set it.

  new.updated_at = now();

-- Example table. Replace "items" with your first real domain table, keeping
-- every column and comment below.

  -- uuid over serial: primary keys are exposed in URLs and logs, and a uuid
  -- is unguessable — sequential ids leak volume and invite enumeration.

  -- point — a row with no owner is a data leak waiting to happen.

  -- sit in different time zones; timestamptz stores an absolute instant.

  updated_at timestamptz not null default now(),

  -- Soft delete: "delete" means hide, not destroy. Rows are recoverable and
  -- auditable; every read query must filter "deleted_at is null".

-- Every query filters by tenant, so tenant_id is the access path. The partial
-- index (deleted_at is null) matches the soft-delete filter that all live
-- reads carry, keeping the index small and always usable.

-- Tenant isolation policy. The application sets the tenant per connection:
--   set_config('app.tenant_id', '<uuid>', true)
-- current_setting(..., true) returns NULL when the setting is absent, and a
-- NULL comparison makes the policy match ZERO rows — a session with no
-- tenant is blocked, it never "sees everything". That failure direction is
-- deliberate: forgetting the tenant must fail closed, not open.
--
-- nullif(..., '') guards the OTHER empty case: a session that explicitly set
-- app.tenant_id to '' (rather than leaving it unset) would otherwise hit a
-- hard cast error ('' does not become a valid uuid) instead of the same
-- fail-closed "zero rows" behavior. nullif turns '' into NULL first, so both
-- "unset" and "set to empty" collapse to the same safe, silent, zero-row
-- outcome — fail closed without an exception leaking policy internals.
-- (On a managed auth platform, swap the right-hand side for the platform's
-- JWT claim accessor; the policy shape stays the same.)
drop policy if exists items_tenant_isolation on items;
