 *      the first commit first means the baseline commit is never blocked by hooks that
 *      aren't set up yet, while every commit AFTER install is properly guarded.
 *   2. install runs last, and its `prepare` script is what switches the hooks on.
 *
 * Never creates a remote repository or a hosting account — that stays the owner's,
 * regardless of where they said they'd version the code (docs/commands.md, Step 4).
 * Steps are independent: a later failure does not undo an earlier success — the copied
 * project is valid either way — so each outcome is reported rather than rolled back.
