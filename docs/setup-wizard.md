# Project-Creation Setup Flow

> **What this document is:** the question script and behavior of the create-a-new-project command,
> **before and during** scaffolding. It collects only what is a matter of the user's taste, infers
> what can be inferred, and ships everything that is a platform decision already made. See
> [pillars.md](pillars.md).
>
> **Status:** the create-a-new-project command is one of three commands that are actually built
> today — alongside running the automatic checks and analyzing an existing project read-only.
> Those three are the whole of what is implemented (plus the Layer B agent harness, which `new` lays
> into every project); the broader family of capabilities this template aims for (automatic deploy,
> staging, rollback, review gate, task board) is still planned, not built. This document describes the
> setup flow the implemented create-a-new-project command runs.
>
> **What "create" actually does today (ground truth):** it copies the official template (web or api)
> into a new project folder, renames the package to the project's name, writes a `keystone.json`
> record of how the project was created, and computes two inferred choices (whether it needs a
> database, and the security level) from the answers. That is the whole of it. It does **not** create
> a git repository, commit, or push; it does **not** provision or connect a database, take or store
> any service key, or run migrations; it does **not** run a design step, install dependencies,
> activate the git hooks, or run any test / check / CI. Everything else described below as
> "the command does X" for versioning, database, and design is **planned, not built** — the questions
> for those rounds are part of the intended flow, but today their answers are only recorded, not
> acted on.

## Three kinds of decision (the golden rule)

1. **Platform decision** (fixed, already settled) → decided by the standard, NOT asked and NOT inferred.
   E.g. errors block shipping, a test ships with the feature, nothing truly disappears from the database.
2. **Inferred decision** (derived from what the user already said) → NOT asked.
   E.g. **does it need a database?** — inferred from project type + data sensitivity.
3. **Project decision** (a matter of the user's taste, only they know) → becomes a question.
   E.g. name, language, screen priority.

> Principle: only ask type 3. The more the flow infers (type 2), the less it burdens the user.

## Round A — Product briefing (the minimal wizard)

The essential minimum. A handful of always-asked questions, plus more that appear only for
database-backed types.

The project name is normalized to a valid package name where the fix is unambiguous — lowercased,
with spaces turned into hyphens (so "My App" becomes "my-app") — instead of being rejected. A name
that is still invalid after that (a leading dot, stray symbols) is refused with a clear message.

### 1. Project name · _free text_

### 2. Project type · _pick one_

- Site / page (showcase, marketing)
- System with login and data (dashboard, authenticated area)
- Service that talks to other systems (an API — the "front door")
- Mobile app

### 3. Starting language · _pt · en · es · other_

### 4. Screen priority · _mobile · desktop · both_

> **Visual identity is not asked at creation.** How a project looks belongs to the design layer,
> applied as a separate (still-planned) step — not a taste forced at birth. Every new project starts
> with the template's neutral default look, and a design skill personalizes it later. Keeping it out
> of creation is deliberate: creation is about structure, not taste (an earlier "pick your look"
> question was ambiguous — it read as light/dark to some — and was dropped).

### 5. Handles sensitive data or money? · _yes · no_ → feeds the security and database inference

### 6. Serves multiple separate clients? · _yes · no_ → only for database-backed types (system/service)

Asked, not assumed — the "ask, don't impose" principle. A template must not presume every project is
a multi-client SaaS, so the question decides the shape of the generated database:

- **Yes (multi-tenant)** → the example database ships with tenant isolation: a `tenant_id` on every
  table and a row-level-security policy keyed on it, plus the tenant-isolation test.
- **No (single-tenant)** → the example database is the simpler single-owner shape: the same table
  without `tenant_id`, without row-level security, and without the isolation test.

Skipped entirely for a plain site (no database), where the question would be noise. Because a site
was never asked, it is treated as single-owner: it gets the same simple single-tenant example
database as an explicit "No" — never the multi-tenant machinery it did not choose (that would break
"ask, don't impose"). Only an explicit "Yes" ships tenant isolation. This is the one piece the
template acts on immediately at creation — the single-tenant variant is applied by the create
command, not merely recorded.

### 7 & 8. Super-admin? · Audit log? · _yes · no each_ → only inside the multi-tenant path

Two more asked-not-assumed questions, shown ONLY when question 6 = multi-tenant (a single-owner
project has no other clients to administer and rarely needs a cross-client tamper-proof log). Each is
independent — neither is bundled with the other or imposed by choosing multi-tenant:

- **Super-admin** → adds a role that can see and act across all clients (for support/administration):
  the row-level-security policy gains an "or is a super-admin" branch, signalled per connection. No →
  every session stays scoped to one client.
- **Audit log** → adds an append-only, tamper-proof record of who changed what, fed automatically by a
  trigger; updates and deletes on it are rejected. No → no audit log.

Both are applied by the create command (the corresponding migration and its test ship only when
chosen), not merely recorded.

## Round B — Technical setup (where the project lives)

Type-3 questions about infrastructure:

- **Where to version** · _pick one_ → GitHub · GitLab · local only (no cloud)
- **Visibility** · _public · private_
- **Parent folder** · _where, on the machine, the project folder will be created_

> The command **creates the project folder itself** inside the parent folder — this part is built: it
> copies the official template into a new folder named after the project. The user does not need to
> create any folder beforehand, nor run the command from inside one.
>
> The versioning and visibility answers, however, are **only recorded** today. The command does **not**
> create a git repository, make a commit, push to GitHub/GitLab, or set repo visibility — that is
> planned, not built. After creation, the developer initializes git and creates the remote repo
> themselves.

## What the flow INFERS on its own (type 2 — not asked)

- **Database need:** from project type + data sensitivity (detailed in the section below).
  - The question "will it have a database?" does NOT exist — it is inferred, not a user choice.
- **Security level:** essential by default; raised to reinforced if question 6 = sensitive.
  - Both of these are computed and written into `keystone.json` — that inference is built. What is
    inferred is a **record**, not an action: nothing is provisioned or configured from it yet.
- **Design-system application:** the visual foundation (fonts, spacing, accessibility, locale
  formatting) is fixed by the standard, and the template already ships it. There is no separate
  design step that "applies" it — a new project simply inherits the foundation the copied template
  already contains. The personality (color / font) is not decided at creation; a separate,
  still-planned design step handles it.

## Database — how the flow resolves it (mostly planned)

> **Built today:** only step 1 — the inference of whether a database is needed, recorded in
> `keystone.json`. Steps 2–6 describe the **intended** database flow and are **not built**: the
> command does not choose or provision a database service, does not ask for or store any access key,
> does not create or connect a database, and does not run migrations. What follows is the design for
> that flow, not a description of running behavior.

1. **Need (inferred, not asked) — BUILT:** from project type + data sensitivity, recorded in
   `keystone.json`.
   - Marketing site → no database (the topic never comes up).
   - System with login / data / sensitive → needs a database.
2. **Database service (planned):** the intent is a default choice, with the option for the user to
   swap it for another. Today the command makes no such choice.
3. **Service access (account + key) — planned, and the honest point:**
   - The command would **NOT create the account** on the service (sign-up / payment is the user's own).
   - **First time (planned):** it would ask for the access key **once** and store it securely in the
     user's environment, **outside the code**. Today it asks for and stores nothing.
   - **Next projects (planned):** it would reuse the stored key — no need to ask again.
4. **Database creation (planned):** with a key in hand, the command would **create the project's
   database and connect it** on its own. Today it does neither; a new project is created with no
   database attached, regardless of the inferred need.
5. **Structural changes (migrations) — planned:** the intent is to always go through the service's
   official tool — deterministically, without AI, at zero cost — so schema changes stay deterministic
   and free of any AI-service dependency, matching the rest of the deterministic foundation. Today the
   command runs no migrations.
6. **AI-to-database bridge (an AI↔database shortcut):** the command does **NOT touch** it — and this
   is true today because the command touches nothing about the database at all. Anyone who wants the
   convenience of querying the database through AI turns it on themselves.

## Presentation (works the same across environments)

- Inside an AI assistant with cards → questions become multiple-choice cards.
- In another environment → questions as plain text.
- Same content, two skins. AI cost only in the AI environment, and only at creation time.
