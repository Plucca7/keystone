Every table follows four conventions, enforced from day one:

- **Unguessable id** — \`uuid\`, never sequential.
- **Owner tag** — \`owner_id\` keeps each client's data separate. Every query filters by it.
- **Stamps** — \`created_at\` / \`updated_at\` on everything.
- **Soft delete** — \`deleted_at\`; nothing truly disappears, it can be recovered.

Structure changes are numbered, repeatable migrations under \`db/migrations/\` — never
made by hand. Run them with your database's official tooling (no AI, zero cost).
